# Libft <img align="left" src="https://github.com/susikohmelo/libft/blob/main/readme_files/score.png" height="120"/>
Recreation of ( the most useful functions of ) the C standard library + a couple extra functions for linked lists.

<br/>

> The functions were made to follow the standard C library equivalents as closely as possible, *including any quirks they may have!* If you see something odd in one of the functions, it is likely because of this.

## Build & use
Download the repo, run `make bonus` or just `make` if you do not want the linked list functions.<br/>
It should output a library file called `libft.a`, compile this with the code you want to use it in.

... Or just copy the source files - up to you!

*( All functions are prefixed with `ft_` to distinguish them from the real C library )*
